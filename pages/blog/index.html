  <h2>Introducing Team Silverblue</h2>
  <p>by Sanja Bonic and Matthias Clasen &ndash; <time datetime="2018-05-04">May 4, 2018</time></p>

    <p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation/AtomicWorkstation">Atomic variant</a>
    of Fedora Workstation has been around for a few years. It has been a low-key operation that
    only a few people knew about and used. By now, most of the necessary pieces of infrastructure
    for a good desktop experience have fallen into place, and it is time to bring the Atomic
    Workstation to a bigger audience.</p>
    <img class="blog-image" alt="Silverblue logo" src="/public/silverblue-logo.svg">
    <p>The <em>Team Silverblue</em> project is about taking the last few steps for turning
    the Atomic Workstation variant into a first-class product, and making it as good or better
    than the traditional variant for most use cases. A particular focus will be on <em>developers</em>,
    and we are working on better support for container-based workflows and pet containers
    in the desktop.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in helping out, please 
    <a href="https://www.teamsilverblue.org/community">join</a> Team Silverblue.
    And if you think your use case would be a good fit for an image-based desktop OS,
    we'd like to <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-atomic-workstation/issues">hear</a> from you!
    <p>We aim to make good progress on this project for Fedora 29 and plan to make the Atomic
    Workstation variant the preferred one by Fedora 30.</p>
