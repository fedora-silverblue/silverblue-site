  <h1>Anatomy of the System</h1>

  <h2>The filesystem: what is read-only and what isn't</h2>

  <p>The root filesystem has the immutable attribute set on OSTree installations,
  so /, /usr and everything below it is readonly. /var is where all the runtime
  state is kept. There are some symlinks that put the state-carrying directories
  in their traditional, expected place:
  <ul>
    <li>/home → /var/home</li>
    <li>/etc → /var/etc</li>
    <li>/mnt → /var/mnt</li>
    <li>/opt → /var/opt</li>
  </ul>
  and so on. If you have a separate home partition on your system, it should be
  mounted on /var/home.</p>

  <h2>Packaging: ostree, rpms, flatpaks and containers</h2>

  <p><em>ostree</em> (and its sibling, rpm-ostree) are responsible for deploying and updating
  the OS image (ie everything below / that is not symlinked into /var). ostree also
  contains the necessary logic to update grub.cfg entries to point to the current
  image.</p>

  <p><em>rpm-ostree</em> builds on top of ostree, and makes it possible to install rpms as a
  'layer' on top of an ostree image. In practice, that means you can install rpms
  as usual, just use rpm-ostree install instead of dnf install. What happens under
  the covers is that rpm-ostree will compose a new OS image by adding the rpm payload
  to the existing OS image, and creating a new, combined image. To see the newly
  installed rpms, you have to reboot into the new image. rpm-ostree also takes care
  of recreating the layered image whenever you update the base OS image.</p>

  <p><em>flatpak</em> uses container technologies to deploy and run desktop applications isolated
  from the underlying OS.</p>

  <p><em>buildah</em> and <em>podman</em> are convenient commandline tools for creating and running
  general containers.</p>
