  <h1>Getting Started</h1>

  <p>Take your first steps with Team Silverblue by following these hints.</p>

  <h2>How do Iâ€¦</h2>

  <h3>Identify the right OS to boot in the bootloader?</h3>

  <p>ostree adds a grub menu item for every commit, this includes updates installed
  with <em>rpm-ostree upgrade</em> and package layering with <em>rpm-ostree install</em>.
  Updated OS images generally get an incremented version number, like:

<pre>
  Fedora 27 (Workstation Edition) 27.72 (ostree)
</pre>

  Currently, layered packages are not easily identified in the grub
  menu. A fix for this is being <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/1239">discussed</a>.</p>

  <h3>Update my system?</h3>

  <p>To get updates for the OS, you can run: <em>rpm-ostree upgrade</em>.
  Starting with Fedora 28, gnome-software will also offer OS
  updates on Atomic systems. Note that due to the atomic nature
  of the OS, you will have to reboot into the new image to
  have the updates take effect.</p>

  <h3>Check for system updates?</h3>

  <p>This command will let you check if updates are available: <em>rpm-ostree upgrade --check</em>.
  Starting with Fedora 28, gnome-software will also notify you about OS updates, just
  like it does on the normal workstation.</p>

  <h3>Update my applications?</h3>

  <p>To update your flatpak applications, you can run: <em>flatpak update</em>.
  gnome-software will also offer flatpak application updates.
  Note that flatpaks are independent of the base system, so you
  can install updates without a reboot, and just restart affected
  applications afterwards to get the new version.</p>

  <h3>Check for application updates?</h3>

  <p>This command will let you check if updates are available: <em>flatpak remote-ls --updates</em>.
  if you add the -d option, it will generate detailed information about the available
  updates:

<pre>
$ flatpak remote-ls --updates -d

  gnome-software will also notify you about application updates, just like it does
  on the normal workstation.</p>

  <h3>Get onto a new OS release? Do I have to reinstall?</h3>

  <p>No, you don't have to reinstall. You can run: <em>rpm-ostree rebase</em>,
  and give it the name of the new OS.
  The process is very similar to a system update: the new OS is
  downloaded and installed in the background, and you just boot into
  it when it is ready.</p>
  <p>Just like system updates, rebases can be reversed: the previous
  deployment is still available, and you can boot back into it if there
  are any problems with the new OS.</p>

  <p>We plan to have gnome-software offer the same functionality in
  Fedora 28 as well.</p>

  <h3>Get my vpn connections back?</h3>

  <p>/etc is not part of the immutable OS image, so you can just copy
  files into /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections (or let NetworkManager
  store them there when you recreate your connections). Certificates
  in /etc/pki need to be handled similarly.</p>

  <h3>Install app xyz?</h3>

  <p>gnome-software has excellent support for installing flatpaks. A convenient
  place to find many popular desktop apps as flatpaks is <a href="http://flathub.org">flathub.org</a>.</p>

  <h3>Get my browser to play youtube videos?</h3>

  <p>firefox is included in the OS image for now. Until that changes, getting it to
  play videos works the same way as it does for the regular Workstation:
  find a package with the needed codecs, and install it. The one difference
  is that you'll use rpm-ostree install instead of dnf install.</p>

  <p>An alternative solution is to install the nightly firefox, which is available
  as a Flatpak <a href="https://firefox-flatpak.mojefedora.cz/org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly.flatpakref">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Install gcc or gdb?</h3>

  <p>This is best done by using a so-called 'pet container' where you can
  install the tools you need. buildah or podman are good tools to set up
  such containers.</p>
