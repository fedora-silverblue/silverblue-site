  <h2>What is Silverblue?</h2>

  <p><em>Silverblue</em> is the new face of Atomic Workstation from Project Atomic.
  With good support for container-focused workflows, this variant of Fedora Workstation
  targets developer communities.</p>

  <p>The use of rpm-ostree for the core OS brings fully atomic upgrades, easy rollbacks and
  workflows that are familiar from OSTree-based servers. Because rpm-ostree is a hybrid
  image/package system, it is also possible to layer RPMs for desktop applications
  which aren't yet Flatpaks, and for "OS extensions" such as powerline and ykclient.</p>

  <p>Moving desktop applications into Flatpak brings stronger isolation, and solves
  longstanding issues with using yum/dnf for desktop applications, such as the fact that
  upgrading deletes the files underneath the running application and often breaks it. (And
  we don't want most desktop applications in the base OSTree stream, since it is meant for
  the "base OS" which goes along with a kernel which requires a reboot).</p>
