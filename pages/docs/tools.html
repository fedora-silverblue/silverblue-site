  <h1>Tools</h1>

  <p>Silverblue systems are updated using <strong>rpm-ostree</strong>.
  An easy way to think about rpm-ostree and its parent project OSTree is
  "git for operating systems." Using rpm-ostree we can easily update the
  system in one atomic transaction, and roll back to the prior system if
  an update has any issues.</p>

  <p>Desktop applications are installed, updated and run using <strong>flatpak</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>buildah</strong> and <strong>podman</strong> are convenient tools
  to create containers.</p>

  <p><strong>oc cluster up</strong> allows developers to test server applications locally
  with ease, and then push them to production Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters. 

  <p>Many developers want random utilities which aren't server apps or desktop apps,
  such as <strong>ansible</strong> for example. We encourage running "pet" containers
  for these where one uses tools like dnf or pip. We are planning to create a desktop
  application that makes it easy to create and manage such "pet" containers.</p>
