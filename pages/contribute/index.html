<h1>How to Contribute</h1>

<p>Team Silverblue is an open community seeking contributors from everywhere, and of every type.
In addition to many core projects needing code in various languages, we also need:
<ul>
  <li>help writing documentation</li>
  <li>expert users to answer questions from less experienced users</li>
  <li>testers who can try out new releases and features</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you are a programmer, please check out
<a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree">rpm-ostree</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak">Flatpak</a> and the many related
projects on GitHub for places to contribute.
We accept pull requests and do not require a CLA.</p>

<p>If you find a problem or want to suggest a feature, you can use the
<a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-atomic-workstation/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Silverblue is a work in progress. Join now and help us to shape its future!</p>
