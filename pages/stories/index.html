  <h2>Welcome to the party, Fedora CoreOS!</h2>
    <p class="author">by Matthias Clasen and Sanja Bonic &ndash; <time datetime="2018-06-21">June 21, 2018</time></p>

    <p>As we learned yesterday, the Fedora family is growing!</p>

    <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-coreos/"><image src="https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fedora-coreos-816x345.jpg"/></a>

    <p>We in Team Silverblue are all excited and happy that Fedora CoreOS will join us to
    push the limits of immutable operating systems and container technology in the larger
    Fedora family.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in helping out, please <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/silverblue">join</a> Team Silverblue.
    And if you think your use case would be a good fit for an image-based desktop OS,
    we'd like to <a href="https://pagure.io/teamsilverblue/issues">hear</a> from you!
    <p>We aim to make good progress on this project for Fedora 29 and plan to make Silverblue
    the preferred Workstation variant by Fedora 30.</p>

  <h2>A look around Team Silverblue</h2>
    <p class="author">by Matthias Clasen and Sanja Bonic &ndash; <time datetime="2018-05-04">May 23, 2018</time></p>

    <p>A few weeks ago, we introduced Team Silverblue as a new initiative in Fedora.</p>

    <p>Now it is time to take a deeper look and see what the project is about and how it works.</p>

    <img class="blog-image" alt="Silverblue logo" src="/public/silverblue-logo.svg">

    <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

    <p>Before we chose the name Team Silverblue, the team was the Fedora Atomic Workstation SIG,
    and the Atomic Workstation is what we are producing, now under its new name,
    <em>Silverblue</em>. At its core, it is a variant of the Fedora Workstation which uses
    rpm-ostree to provide an immutable OS image with reliable updates and easy rollbacks.</p>

    <p>The concrete goals of the Team Silverblue project are to provide excellent support for
    container-based workflows and make Silverblue the preferred variant of Fedora Workstation.
    We want to reach these goals by the time Fedora 30 is released.</p>

    <p>To get there, we need to close a number of remaining gaps in the Flatpak and OSTree support
    in GNOME Software, and improve the support for contrainer-based workflows in the desktop.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install all desktop apps as Flatpaks
      <li>Support package layering for OS extensions in GNOME Software
      <li>Good support for "pet containers" in the desktop
      <li>Support rollbacks in GNOME Software
      <li>Support rebases in GNOME Software
      <li>Support kernel modules in rpm-ostree
    </ul>
    <p>You can take a look at our <a href="https://pagure.io/teamsilverblue/issues">issue tracker</a>
    to find out more about these and other tasks.</p>

    <h3>Infrastructure</h3>

    <p>Like most projects, Team Silverblue has a <a href="https://teamsilverblue.org">website</a>
    (the one you're on now, in fact). It serves as the central point for information around Silverblue.
    Over time, we hope to make this a go-to place for learning more about Linux and containers.</p>

    <p>The Silverblue iso image and OSTree repository are built and hosted in the Fedora build
    infrastructure.</p>

    <p>If you want to get in touch with team members, there are several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Silverblue <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/silverblue">community</a> is an excellent
          place to ask a question or discuss Silverblue topics
      <li>Alternatively, there is a &num;silverblue IRC channel on freenode
      <li>If you want to report an issue or make a suggestion, you can use the <a href="https://pagure.io/teamsilverblue/issues">issue tracker</a>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="introducing-silverblue">Introducing Team Silverblue</h2>
    <p class="author">by Matthias Clasen and Sanja Bonic &ndash; <time datetime="2018-05-04">May 4, 2018</time></p>
    <p>Good news, everyone! In some parts of the world it is still May the 4th. And with this date comes great responsibility. Let's talk about Silverblue.</p>
    </p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Workstation/AtomicWorkstation">Atomic variant</a>
    of Fedora Workstation has been around for a few years. It has been a low-key operation that
    only a few people knew about and used. By now, most of the necessary pieces of infrastructure
    for a good desktop experience have fallen into place, and it is time to bring the Atomic
    Workstation to a bigger audience.</p>

    <blockquote>Atomic Workstation is dead. Long live Silverblue.</blockquote>

    <img class="blog-image" alt="Silverblue logo" src="/public/silverblue-logo.svg">

    <p>The <em>Team Silverblue</em> project is about taking the last few steps for turning
    the Atomic Workstation variant into a first-class product, and making it as good or better
    than the traditional variant for most use cases. A particular focus will be on <em>developers</em>,
    and we are working on better support for container-based workflows and pet containers
    in the desktop.</p>
