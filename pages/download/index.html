<h1>Download a Silverblue image</h1>

<p>Silverblue images for Fedora 28 are provided by the Fedora Project.</p>
<p><a class="button" href='https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/28/AtomicWorkstation/x86_64/iso/Fedora-AtomicWorkstation-ostree-x86_64-28-1.1.iso'><svg class="icon"><use href="/public/svg-sprites.svg#download" /></svg>64-bit 1.9GB Silverblue image (Fedora 28)</a></p>

<p>Fedora provides the Media Writer as a convenient way to create bootable USB drives.</p>
<p>You will need
<ul>
<li>The Silverblue image (download above)
<li>Fedora Media Writer (download below)
<li>A USB Flash drive with at least 2GB space available
</ul>
</p>
<p>Download the Silverblue image and the Fedora Media Writer program for your OS.
In the Media Writer window, click "Custom image", select the Silverblue image,
and follow the prompts to write the image to the USB Drive.</p>

<p>You may then install Silverblue by booting from your USB Drive. <b>Note:</b> it is
advisable to keep the default partitioning setup that the Installer suggests,
since rpm-ostree expects this setup.</p>
