    <p class="author">by Matthias Clasen and Sanja Bonic &ndash; <time datetime="2018-06-21">June 21, 2018</time></p>

    <p>As we learned yesterday, the Fedora family is growing!</p>

    <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-coreos/"><image src="https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fedora-coreos-816x345.jpg"/></a>

    <p>We in Team Silverblue are all excited and happy that Fedora CoreOS will join us to
    push the limits of immutable operating systems and container technology in the larger
    Fedora family.</p>
