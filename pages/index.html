  <h2>Welcome to the party, Fedora CoreOS!</h2>
    <p class="author">by Matthias Clasen and Sanja Bonic &ndash; <time datetime="2018-06-21">June 21, 2018</time></p>

    <p>As we learned yesterday, the Fedora family is growing!</p>

    <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-coreos/"><image src="https://fedoramagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fedora-coreos-816x345.jpg"/></a>

    <p>We in Team Silverblue are all excited and happy that Fedora CoreOS will join us to
    push the limits of immutable operating systems and container technology in the larger
    Fedora family.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in helping out, please <a href="https://community.teamsilverblue.org">join</a> Team Silverblue.
    And if you think your use case would be a good fit for an image-based desktop OS,
    we'd like to <a href="https://pagure.io/teamsilverblue/issues">hear</a> from you!
    <p>We aim to make good progress on this project for Fedora 29 and plan to make Silverblue
    the preferred Workstation variant by Fedora 30.</p>
